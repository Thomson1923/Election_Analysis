# Re: Analysis of Congressional Election Results

# Overview
## Per your request, we developed code that tabulated Congressional election voting results from raw data in .csv format (**INSERT LINK**) and created a simple text output to summarize the outcome of the election (**INSERT LINK**). As discussed, the code developed for this election (** INSERT LINK **) can be easily modified to tabulate votes and produce output for other elections.

# Election Audit Results
## Key results from the Congressional election are as follows:
## - A total of 369,711 votes were cast in this district
## - The breakdown of votes by county was:
### - Arapahoe = 24,801 (6.7% of total)
### - Denver = 306,055 (82.8% of total)
### - Jefferson = 38,855 (10.5% of total)
## - As expected, the greatest number of votes were placed in Denver county
## - The breakdown of votes by candidate was:
### - Charles Casper Stockham =  85,213 (23.0% of total)
### - Diane DeGette = 272,892 (73.8% of total)
### - Raymon Anthony Doane = 11,606 (3.1% of total)
## - Our analysis shows that Diane DeGette won the election with 272,892 votes (73.8% of total)

# Election Audit Summary
## We hope that the information presented above demonstrates that the code developed in this project will provide a rapid and accurate means for counting and analyzing votes in other elections. At your convenience, we would like to discuss the initiation of a new project to (1) tabulate the results for multiple races from a single .csv file (which would require the addition of an “FOR” loop to address the multiple races) as well as (2) compile voting data for the entire state by opening and analyzing multiple .csv files in one set of code. Please let me know when it would be convenient to address initial details of this secondary project.
